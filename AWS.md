# Cloud Computing:
On demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

## Explaintation:
Access computing resources (like servers, storage, database, and software) over the internet, rather than owning
and maintaining physical hardware.

# Cloud Service provider:
- Amazon Web Service (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google cloud Platform (GCP)
- IBM Cloud
- Oracle Cloud
- Alibaba Cloud
- Digital Ocean
- Sales force
- VMware Cloud
- Rackspace Cloud

Virtualization is the proces of creating multiple simulated environments or virtual machines form a single physical hardware system, enabling more efficient resource use.

# Type of Cloud computing
- Iaas (infrastructure as a Service)
- Paas (Platform as a Service)
- Saas  (Software as a Service)

### Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service)
You get virtual infrastructure
You manage almost everything except the physical hardware

You manager
 - OS
 - Runtime
 - Middleware
 - Application
 - Data

 Provider Managers
 - Physical servers
 - Storage
 - Networking
 - Virtualization

 Example
 - AWS EC2
 - Azure Virtual Machine

 ## Paas (Platform as a Service)
 You focus on code
 The platform manages infrastructure + runtime
 You manage:

 - Application code
 - Data

 Provider Manages
 - Infrastructure
 - OS
 - Runtime
 - Middleware
 - Scaling
 Examples
 Azure App Service
 AWS Elastic Beanstalk
 Google App Engine
 ### Best for : fast development, less ops work

 ## Saas (Software as a Service)
 You just use the software
 Everything is managed by the provider

 You manage:
 - Users
 - Data (input/output)

 Provider manages
 - Application
 - Platform
 - Infrastructure
 - Updates
 - Security

 Examples
 - Gmail
 - Microsoft 365
 - Salesforce
 - Zoom
