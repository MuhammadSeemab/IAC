# Slide 1 Introduction and Agenda

### Github Copilot use a model that has been trained on many code repositories.

### And before learning what is model, we need to understand what is generative AI. Once we understand the basics of generative AI, and along with that, we will also learn about generative AI use cases

### We will start learning about the terms like machine learning, artificial intelligence, how machine learning, and artificial intelligence is connected. We will also learn about model.

### What is a model? How to train a model, and what kind of model is being used in GitHub copilot.

### GitHub Copilot, how it has been trained, and what are the different models that are available now with GitHub copilot.
### We will first understand what is GitHub Copilot and what are its various features, why it is so much popular and why it is being widely adopted by various enterprise organizations.

### We also need to understand what are the various GitHub Copilot subscriptions, because we need to use. GitHub Copilot for our day to day work.
## That is why we need to understand what are the limitations in these subscriptions? Which features are available and which features are not available?

## Once we are good with it, we will start learning about prompt engineering in order to get the best out of GitHub copilot.

## There are few strategies of prompt engineering which can help us to achieve our day to day tasks quickly and efficiently.

## As a DevOps or DevSecOps engineers, we are given various tasks in a sprint or in a program increment, and in order to complete those tasks within the defined timeline, we need to provide accurate prompts to GitHub Copilot.

## So we will learn few strategies and we will see some hands on demos with these prompt engineering strategies. Using GitHub.com.
## If you are not aware, we will learn that in this section once we have learned about the prompt engineering

## strategies with GitHub Copilot, we will then jump into a case study. This case study we will implement for DevOps engineers using GitHub Copilot in this case study.

### First, we will understand this case study where we will implement an end to end CI CD pipeline with the help of GitHub Copilot.So there will be few prerequisites that will be required for this case study.

## So during this entire journey, you will learn about the basics of generative AI.

You will learn about GitHub Copilot and its features.

You will learn about the subscriptions that are available.

The prompt engineering strategies.

With GitHub Copilot, you will do hands on demos using this prompt engineering, and also you will implement

an enterprise level case study for DevOps and DevSecOps engineers using GitHub Copilot.
