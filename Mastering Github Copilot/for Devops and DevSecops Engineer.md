# Slide 1 Introduction and Agenda

### Github Copilot use a model that has been trained on many code repositories.

### And before learning what is model, we need to understand what is generative AI. Once we understand the basics of generative AI, and along with that, we will also learn about generative AI use cases

### We will start learning about the terms like machine learning, artificial intelligence, how machine learning, and artificial intelligence is connected. We will also learn about model.

### What is a model? How to train a model, and what kind of model is being used in GitHub copilot.

### GitHub Copilot, how it has been trained, and what are the different models that are available now with GitHub copilot.
### We will first understand what is GitHub Copilot and what are its various features, why it is so much popular and why it is being widely adopted by various enterprise organizations.

### We also need to understand what are the various GitHub Copilot subscriptions, because we need to use. GitHub Copilot for our day to day work.
## That is why we need to understand what are the limitations in these subscriptions? Which features are available and which features are not available?

## Once we are good with it, we will start learning about prompt engineering in order to get the best out of GitHub copilot.

## There are few strategies of prompt engineering which can help us to achieve our day to day tasks quickly and efficiently.

## As a DevOps or DevSecOps engineers, we are given various tasks in a sprint or in a program increment, and in order to complete those tasks within the defined timeline, we need to provide accurate prompts to GitHub Copilot.

## So we will learn few strategies and we will see some hands on demos with these prompt engineering strategies. Using GitHub.com.
## If you are not aware, we will learn that in this section once we have learned about the prompt engineering

## strategies with GitHub Copilot, we will then jump into a case study. This case study we will implement for DevOps engineers using GitHub Copilot in this case study.

### First, we will understand this case study where we will implement an end to end CI CD pipeline with the help of GitHub Copilot.So there will be few prerequisites that will be required for this case study.

## So during this entire journey, you will learn about the basics of generative AI.

You will learn about GitHub Copilot and its features.

You will learn about the subscriptions that are available.

The prompt engineering strategies.

With GitHub Copilot, you will do hands on demos using this prompt engineering, and also you will implement

an enterprise level case study for DevOps and DevSecOps engineers using GitHub Copilot.

# Generative AI
###  generative AI is made up of two terms gen and I. Where AI stands for artificial intelligence. We are building artificial intelligence in machines to generate various types of content. This content can be images.
### We can use gen AI or generative AI to generate images for us. By giving some context, we can ask generative AI models to generate images for us.
### Similarly, we can use these models to write code for developers, DevOps engineers, DevSecOps engineers,

### QA engineers as well. If you are working in Java, you can ask generative AI model to write a Java file. If you are writing a Terraform file, you can ask generative AI to write a Terraform file.If you are in DevSecOps, you can ask generative AI model to Integrate security tools in CI CD pipelines.

## Hence the applications are unlimited.
For example, if the model has been trained on Node.js, it will be able to generate code in Node.js. But if the generative AI model is not trained on Node.js, it will not be able to generate code.

This is very popular, as you might already be using ChatGPT from OpenAI for generating text, but there are other AI solutions as well that help us in generating text.
Let's first see AI solutions available in market that helps to generate images.

One is Dall-E. Dall-E is from OpenAI that helps to generate pictures or images.

The next one is Artbreeder. Artbreeder is another AI solution that helps to generate images.

Similarly, Deepart is also one popular example as well.

One popular is ChatGPT.

You might have already used ChatGPT.

Now ChatGPT has multiple models, which is ChatGPT 3.5, four and 40, and each model is an improved

version of the previous one.

Then copy AI is another popular Gen I example.

Third is Jasper, which is widely used in the market as well.

There are others as well, but I have listed the most popular ones here.

Let's see some AI solutions for generating music.

One is Musenet.

Second is Aiwa and third is Amper.

**These three solutions are available in the market, which are quite popular examples of JNI.
**
And finally, the most focused category here is code generation examples.

And finally, the most focused category here is code generation examples.

Very popular is **Microsoft Copilot**.

The next is** code T5 and Tab nine Copilot code T5**.

Tab nine are quite popular in the market for generating code, and all these tools represent some of

the use cases of generative AI.

# Generative AI - Basic Terms

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior.

Think of artificial intelligence as a science of making computers smart, enabling these computers to perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence.

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem solving, understanding, natural language, and even perception.

Artificial intelligence makes the computers capable to learn new things, to reason before taking any decision, to solve complex problems, to understand natural language, and to have perception.

**But how does artificial intelligence do that?**

**And how does artificial intelligence make computers capable of these capabilities?**
